                    <p class="leading-relaxed">
                        This Retirement Simulator tool is provided for educational and planning purposes only. It is not legal, financial, tax, or accounting advice. The information and projections provided by this tool are based on assumptions you provide and historical data, but actual results may differ materially.

                        We make no representations or warranties, express or implied, regarding the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any information provided by this tool.

                    <p class="leading-relaxed">
                        Past performance is not indicative of future results. Market returns, inflation, and other economic factors are inherently unpredictable. The simulations provided are based on historical averages and assumptions that may not hold in the future.

                    <p class="leading-relaxed">
                        This tool's simulations have important limitations. They assume consistent withdrawal strategies and don't account for sequencing risk (poor returns early in retirement having outsized impact), market cycles, recessions, geopolitical events, or major life changes. The simulations are based on historical return distributions but cannot predict specific market conditions. Real retirement is more complex: you may adjust spending in downturns, change investment strategies, earn additional income, or face unexpected major expenses. Use these results as one input to your planning, not as definitive predictions.

                    <p class="leading-relaxed">
                        Before making any financial, investment, tax, or legal decisions, you should consult with qualified professionals such as a financial advisor, tax professional, or attorney who understands your specific situation.
