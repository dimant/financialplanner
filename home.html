    The <strong>Retirement Planner</strong> helps you estimate your future portfolio value and the likelihood of meeting your retirement goals by simulating your savings, investment returns, expenses, and inflation over time. The <strong>Home Purchase Planner</strong> allows you to model the financial impact of buying a home, including mortgage payments, home appreciation, equity growth, and ownership costs, so you can make informed decisions about your real estate investment.
